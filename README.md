# Winter of Making!

A ~~rip-off~~ economy mod based on [Hackclub's Summer of Making!](https://summer.hackclub.com) Ironically it was made
for [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com) and for [Hackcraft!](https://hackcraft.hackclub.com)  
Instead of shells, it uses snowflakes as the currency. It also has a small shop with 8[^1] unique items!  
You can earn snowflakes from trading or crafting! ... I don't know if earn is the right word anymore.  
I dunno what more to say, it's simple but hopefully appreciated <3!  
Anyways, I hope you like it!

## The snowflake
